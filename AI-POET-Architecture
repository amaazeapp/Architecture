Objective - The project is part of Research and Development on building AI Deep Learning  model's in the field of human creativity. 
The model would generate poems around Life given initial opening stanza provided by user 
Below is the overall architectural overview of the End to End system 

Model Architectural - Tensor Flow - Deep Learning 
Model Framework - Recurrent Neural Network consisting of Encoder and Decoder 

The Encoder is built on LSTM cells . On top of the Encoder there is a attention mechanism implemented . The output 
of the attention mechanism is a attention vector.

Training Phase - The training is done on a dataset consisting of poems on life
